Welcome to the easiest way to see how LaunchDarkly can transform your business by impementing a simple yet powerful feature flagging SDK

This example is a simple pricing application, where different users will get different pricing, depending on the rules you set for your users.

Prerequisites:

To use this example, you will need the following:

1. An LaunchDarkly Acount:

If you don't have a LauncDarkly account, create one!

You must set up a LaunchDarkly project and environment where your flags will live. Create a new project or use an existing one in your account.

To create a new project:

a. Navigate to the Account settings page.
b. Click the Projects tab in the top navigation.
c. Click Create project button in blue. The "Create a project" panel appears.
d. Give your project a human-readable Name, so you can find it easily later.
e. Click Create project. The new project's Environments tab appears.
f. Click the "Production" environment SDK key to copy it to your clipboard: VERY IMPORTANT - you will need this number later!

2. A GitHub account  - you probably have one if you are reading this right now, but if you don't, sign up at github.com and follow the instructions
